# Challenge 6: The Punctual Engineer

There are several approaches to generating prompts for the Azure OpenAI service. One of the most popular approaches is to use a technique called *prompt engineering* to generate prompts that are used to generate completions. Prompt engineering is an iterative process that involves generating prompts, generating completions, and evaluating the results. The results of the evaluation are used to generate new prompts, and the process repeats until the desired results are achieved. An emerging pattern is to create a prompt flow, or pipeline, that structures the initial prompt, service calls for embeddings, search, and completions, return responses, etc.

The starter solution uses Semantic Kernel for prompt engineering. This challenge is about experimenting with system prompts to impact how the completions model works.

## Challenge

Your team must:

1. Create different response formats from the completions model:
   1. Respond with a single number
   2. Respond with a bulleted list of products
   3. Respond with JSON-formatted data
2. Have the agent reject or filter offensive language.
