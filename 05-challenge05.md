# Challenge 5: Get Into the Flow

Prompt engineering is an evolving field, and there are many different approaches to generating prompts for the Azure OpenAI service. One of the most popular approaches is to use a technique called *prompt engineering* to generate prompts that are used to generate completions. Prompt engineering is an iterative process that involves generating prompts, generating completions, and evaluating the results. The results of the evaluation are used to generate new prompts, and the process repeats until the desired results are achieved. An emerging pattern is to create a prompt flow, or pipeline, that structures the initial prompt, service calls for embeddings, search, and completions, return responses, etc. You and your team have pieced together the components of the CosmicWorks chat interface, but now it's time to get into the flow.

## Challenge

Your team must:

1. Implement a prompt flow that structures the initial prompt, service calls for embeddings, search, and completions, return responses, etc.
2. Use Semantic Kernel to build the prompt flow.
