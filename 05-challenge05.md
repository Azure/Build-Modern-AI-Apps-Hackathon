# Challenge 5: It's All About the Payload, The Sequel

What you've built so far is a pattern you can use with any type of data. You've built a data pipeline that can be used to load data from a storage account into Cosmos DB, and you've built a process that can be used to generate vector embeddings for products and accounts. Now it's time to test your pattern by loading a completely new data type.

## Challenge

Your team must:

1. Create a new index in the vector database for the new data type.
2. Load the new data type into Cosmos DB.
3. Use the chat interface to ask questions about the new data type.
