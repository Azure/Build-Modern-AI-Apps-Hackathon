# Challenge 3: Now We're Flying

With the critical components in place, we're ready to tie everything into the chat interface. When a user types a question into the chat interface, we need to create a vector embedding for the question, then search for the most similar vector embeddings for products and accounts, and return the relevant documents that get sent to Azure OpenAI's completions endpoint. 

In order to return a human-friendly response to the user, we need to use the completions endpoint to generate a response based on the most relevant documents and an instructional system-level prompt. Furthermore, we need to keep a history of the user's questions and the responses that were generated so that they can reload the chat in the future.

To generate prompts for the Azure OpenAI service, the approach is to use a technique called *prompt engineering* to author prompts that are used to guide the generation of completions. Prompt engineering is an iterative process that involves authoring prompts, generating completions, and evaluating the results. 

The starter solution uses Semantic Kernel to orchestrate the execution of prompts. This challenge is about experimenting with system prompts to impact how the completions work.

## Challenge

Your team must:

1. Use the Azure OpenAI service to create vector embeddings for the user prompt that is entered into the chat interface. Invoke the completions endpoint to generate a response based on the most relevant documents and some instructional system-level prompts. The system prompt should be included with every completions call, but not repeated in the chat history. Use Semantic Kernel as they stubbed out in the project to make this call. 
2. Create the system prompt that defines the assistant's behavior. CosmicWorks has provided you with a starter prompt located under VectorSearchAiAssistant\SystemPrompts\RetailAssistant\Default.txt. You should add to the content in this file. The system prompt should instruct the model to do the following:
   1. Tell it that it is an intelligent assistant for a bike company.
   2. Tell it that it is responding to user questions about products, product categories, customers, and sales order information provided in JSON format embedded below.
   3. Only answer questions related to the information provided.
   4. Not to "make up" information and to respond that it does not know the answer to suggest to the user to search for it themselves.
   5. Make sure the prompt ends with "Text of relevant information:" as after that the system will inject context data and chat history. 
3. Upload the system prompt file to the Azure Storage Account, place it under the path `system-prompt / RetailAssistant` overwriting the file that is there.
4. Store the user's questions and the responses that were generated so the system can reload them in the future.

### Hints

- CosmicWorks has provided starter code for you. Search for the two methods with `TODO: Challenge 3` and complete them as instructed.
- Think carefully about the system prompt, about how it should respond, what knowledge it is allowed to use when reasoning to create a response, what subjects it is allowed to respond to and importantly what it should not respond to.
- Have the agent reject off topic prompts from the user (such as asks to tell a joke).


### Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you must:

- Demonstrate to your coach that you can load the system prompt from the storage account.
- Interact with the assistant thru the web based chat interface.
- View the chat messages saved to the container in Cosmos DB and verify that your new User and Assistant messages are appearing.
- Try a variety of user prompts to see how the assistant responds.
