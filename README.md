# Azure Cosmos DB & OpenAI: Bring Your Own Data to ChatGPT Hackathon

CosmicWorks has big plans for their retail site. They're eager to launch a POC of a simple chat interface where users can interact with a virtual agent to find product and account information.

The scenario centers around a consumer retail "Intelligent Agent" that allows users to ask questions on vectorized product, customer and sales order data stored in a database. The data in this solution is the Cosmic Works sample for Azure Cosmos DB. This data is an adapted subset of the Adventure Works 2017 dataset for a retail Bike Shop that sells bicycles, biking accessories, components and clothing.

> BUT you can bring your own data instead.
