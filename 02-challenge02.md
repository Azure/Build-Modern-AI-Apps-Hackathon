# Challenge 2: It's All About the Payload

CosmicWorks has years of product, customer, and sales data that they exported to an Azure storage account. They want to load this data into the Azure Cosmos DB account for a future migration of their e-Commerce site to Azure, but also for the POC of the chat interface. They also want to load the data into the vector database so that they can search for product and account information by the vector embeddings.

## Challenge

Your team must:

1. Find an efficient and repeatable way to load data from the storage account into Cosmos DB. For this exercise, you only need to load the data once, but CosmicWorks wants to be able to repeat the process in the future with new data.
2. Verify that the data was loaded into Cosmos DB.

### Hints

- Hint 1

### Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you must:

- Demonstrate to your coach that you can load the data from the storage account into Cosmos DB using a method that can be repeated in the future.
- Perform a document count on each container in Cosmos DB and verify that the counts match the number of documents in the storage account.
